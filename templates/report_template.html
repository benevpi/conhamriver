<div class="disclaimer">
    This tool uses a simplified "upstream" test based on longitude and/or latitude. For Conham, CSOs east of the site are counted as upstream. This may include or miss some actual upstream sources, especially in complex river sections.
    <br>Distances are as the crow flies (not measured along the river or watercourse).

<div class="generated-time">The risk is based entirely on the author's personal risk tolerance. River swimming is never 100% safe, so it's up to you to make an informed decision </div>

<div class="generated-time">This system is currently being tested and may produce unexpected or inaccurate results, but it's trying it's hardest</div>
